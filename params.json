{"name":"Cabal TeamCity Build Runner Plugin","body":"### Description\r\n\r\n[TeamCity][] is a continuous integration server. [Cabal][] is a build and\r\npackage manager for [Haskell][] programs and libraries. Even though you can quite easily invoke a build of a Cabalised Haskell program by running `cabal-install` through the command line runner, common operations such as managing and editing of build parameters or digging through long build logs can be a bit of a pain.\r\n\r\nCabal TeamCity Build Runner Plugin presents a tighter integration of the Cabal build process\r\nwith TeamCity with these features:\r\n - Effortless configuration: set up and configure a Cabal runner Build Step from a standard Build Configuration page\r\n - Properties: the `cabal-install` tool's location and version are exposed as Agent Parameters, allowing you to discriminate between build agents by the version of `cabal-install`\r\n - Hierarchical build log: it is now much easier to dig through heaps of build output,  thanks to TeamCity presenting the hierarchical structure as of the build log as a with the Tree View\r\n - Basic test reporting: see the number of successful and failed QuickCheck, QuickCheck 2 and HUnit test runs at a glance for when your test-suite built with Max Bolingbroke's (@batterseapower) wonderful `test-framework` (site [here][test-framework])\r\n\r\nFinally! Quick and easy Continuous Integration for Haskell!\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nTo get the plugin running, simply download `cabalRunner.jar` from the [Downloads section][Project downloads]\r\nand drop it into your `~teamcity/.BuildServer/plugins` directory, where `~teamcity` is the home directory\r\nof the UNIX user used to run TeamCity Server, or the `<TeamCity Data Directory>/plugins` directory under Windows.\r\n\r\n### Upgrading\r\nWhen you would like to upgrade to a newer version of the plugin where a previous version of the\r\nplugin has been installed already, simply overwrite the existing `cabalRunner.zip` file with the latest\r\nreleased zip file.\r\n\r\nTeamCity Server sees the change, and will _automatically trigger an Agent-side upgrade_ for the plugin.\r\nTeamCity Server however will not upgrade the plugin unless you restart it, so be sure to do that\r\nto ensure new version of the plugin becomes activated.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nCabal TeamCity Build Runner Plugin began as a very small hobby project, and was implemented in the space of a few days. In the likely even you find an issue, ping me on fushunpoon@googlemail.com. We'll see what we can do from there.\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nCabal TeamCity Build Runner Plugin is actually a derived work of [Teamcity Unity3d Build Runner plugin](https://github.com/mcmarkb/Teamcity-unity3d-build-runner-plugin) so I wish to give attribution to Mark Baker (@mcmarkb) for laying the groundwork for this plugin.\r\n\r\nPlease fork this project and help me improve it!
