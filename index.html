        <h3>What's this plugin all about?</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/" title="TeamCity main website (JetBrains)">TeamCity</a> is a continuous integration server. <a href="http://www.haskell.org/cabal/" title="Haskell Cabal main website">Cabal</a> is a build and
package manager for <a href="http://www.haskell.org/" title="Haskell main website">Haskell</a> programs and libraries. Even though you can quite easily invoke a build of a Cabalised Haskell program by running <code>cabal-install</code> through the command line runner, common operations such as managing and editing of build parameters or digging through long build logs can be a bit of a pain.</p>

        <h4>Features</h4>
<p>Cabal TeamCity Build Runner Plugin presents a tighter integration of the Cabal build process
with TeamCity with these features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Effortless configuration: set up and configure a Cabal runner Build Step from a standard Build Configuration page</li>
<li>Properties: the <code>cabal-install</code> tool's location and version are exposed as Agent Parameters, allowing you to discriminate between build agents by the version of <code>cabal-install</code>
</li>
<li>Hierarchical build log: it is now much easier to dig through heaps of build output,  thanks to TeamCity presenting the hierarchical structure as of the build log as a with the Tree View</li>
<li>Basic test reporting: see the number of successful and failed QuickCheck, QuickCheck 2 and HUnit test runs at a glance for when your test-suite built with Max Bolingbroke's (<a href="https://github.com/batterseapower" class="user-mention">@batterseapower</a>) wonderful <code>test-framework</code> (site <a href="http://batterseapower.github.com/test-framework/" title="Test framework make site">here</a>)</li>
</ul><p>Finally! Quick and easy Continuous Integration for Haskell!</p>

<h3>Download and Install</h3>

<div id="downloads">
    <a class="zip_download_link" href="https://github.com/downloads/fushunpoon/cabal-teamcity-plugin/cabalRunner.zip">Download latest release</a>
</div>

<p>Grab <code>cabalRunner.zip</code> from above or the GitHub repository's <a
        href="https://github.com/fushunpoon/cabal-teamcity-plugin/downloads"
        title="Project download page">Downloads section</a>, and then drop it into
    either <code>~teamcity/.BuildServer/plugins</code> directory (UNIX)
    (where <code>~teamcity</code> is the home directory of the UNIX user used to run
    TeamCity Server) or the <code>&lt;TeamCity Data Directory&gt;/plugins</code> (Windows).</p>

<h3>Upgrade</h3>

<p>Simply overwrite the existing <code>cabalRunner.zip</code> file with the latest released zip
    file if you've already installed an earlier version of this plugin before.</p>

<p>TeamCity Server sees the change, and will <em>automatically trigger an Agent-side upgrade</em> for the plugin.
TeamCity Server however will not upgrade the plugin unless you restart it, so be sure to do that
to ensure new version of the plugin becomes activated.</p>

<hr><h3>Contact</h3>

<p>Cabal TeamCity Build Runner Plugin began as a very small hobby project, and was implemented in the space of a few days. In the likely even you find an issue, ping me on <a href="mailto:fushunpoon@googlemail.com">fushunpoon@googlemail.com</a>. We'll see what we can do from there.</p>

<h3>Contributing</h3>

<p>Cabal TeamCity Build Runner Plugin is actually a derived work of <a href="https://github.com/mcmarkb/Teamcity-unity3d-build-runner-plugin">Teamcity Unity3d Build Runner plugin</a> so I wish to give attribution to Mark Baker (<a href="https://github.com/mcmarkb" class="user-mention">@mcmarkb</a>) for laying the groundwork for this plugin.</p>

<p>Please fork this project and help me improve it! Start by looking at some of
