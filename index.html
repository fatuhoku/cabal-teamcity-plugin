        <h3>About</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/" title="TeamCity main website (JetBrains)">TeamCity</a> is a continuous integration server. <a href="http://www.haskell.org/cabal/" title="Haskell Cabal main website">Cabal</a> is a build and
package manager for <a href="http://www.haskell.org/" title="Haskell main website">Haskell</a> programs and libraries. Even though you can quite easily invoke a build of a Cabalised Haskell program by running <code>cabal-install</code> through the command line runner, common operations such as managing and editing of build parameters or digging through long build logs can be a bit of a pain.</p>

        <h4>What you get...</h4>
<p>This plugin integrates the Cabal build process with TeamCity in the following ways:</p>

        <h6>Easy configuration</h6>
        <img class="screenshot" src="images/cabal-config-page.png" alt="TeamCity build progress"/>
        Set up and configure a Cabal runner Build Step from a standard Build Configuration page.

        <h5>Exposed agent properties</h5>
        <code>cabal-install</code>'s location and version are exposed as Agent Parameters called
        <code>cabal.path</code> and <code>cabal.version</code>, allowing you to discriminate between build agents by <code>cabal-install</code>'s version.

        <h5>Build progress reporting and hierarchical build log</h5>
        <img class="screenshot" src="images/build-progress-indicators.png" alt="TeamCity build progress"/>
        TeamCity is notified of build events by monitoring Cabal's real time build output,
        allowing you to navigate it with TeamCity's standard Build Output page.

        <h5><code>test-framework</code> integration for basic test reporting</h5>
        <img class="screenshot" src="images/test-reporting.png" alt="TeamCity build progress"/>
        See the number of successful and failed QuickCheck, QuickCheck 2, Smallcheck and/or HUnit test runs at a glance for test suites built with Max Bolingbroke's (<a href="https://github.com/batterseapower" class="user-mention">@batterseapower</a>) <a href="http://batterseapower.github.com/test-framework/">test-framework</a>.

<br/>
<br/>
Finally! Quick and easy Continuous Integration for Haskell!</p>

<h3>Download and Install</h3>

<div id="downloads">
    <a class="zip_download_link" href="https://github.com/downloads/fushunpoon/cabal-teamcity-plugin/cabalRunner.zip">Download latest release</a>
</div>

<p>Grab <code>cabalRunner.zip</code> (latest release v0.5) from above (or alternatively, <a
        href="https://github.com/fushunpoon/cabal-teamcity-plugin/downloads"
        title="Project download page">here</a>) and drop it into
    either <code>~teamcity/.BuildServer/plugins</code> directory (UNIX)
    (where <code>~teamcity</code> is the home directory of the UNIX user used to run
    TeamCity Server) or the <code>&lt;TeamCity Data Directory&gt;/plugins</code> directory (Windows).</p>
    The exact locations of these depend on where you chose to install TeamCity.

<h3>Upgrade</h3>

<p>Simply overwrite the existing <code>cabalRunner.zip</code> wherever you
    installed the earlier version with the latest released zipfile.</p>

<p>TeamCity Server will see the updated zipfile and will <em>automatically
        trigger an Agent-side upgrade</em> for the plugin. However, TeamCity
    Server itself will not automatically switch to using the updated version of
    the plugin until after a restart, so be sure to restart TeamCity Server in order
    to activate the latest version.</p>

<h3>Contact</h3>

<p>Cabal TeamCity Build Runner Plugin began as a very small hobby project, and was implemented in the space of a few days. In the likely event you find an issue, ping me on <a href="mailto:fushunpoon@googlemail.com">fushunpoon@googlemail.com</a>. We'll see what we can do from there.</p>

<h3>Contributing</h3>

<p>Cabal TeamCity Build Runner Plugin is actually a derived work of <a href="https://github.com/mcmarkb/Teamcity-unity3d-build-runner-plugin">Teamcity Unity3d Build Runner plugin</a> so I wish to thank Mark Baker (<a href="https://github.com/mcmarkb" class="user-mention">@mcmarkb</a>) for letting his project be modified beyond recognition.</p>

<p>Please fork this project and help me improve it! There is more work to be done for a totally seamless user experince. Start by looking at some of the <a href="https://github.com/fushunpoon/cabal-teamcity-plugin">known issues</a> section of the README. Thanks!</p>
